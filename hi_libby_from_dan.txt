Hi Libby!

Just a quick note.  Was good fun meeting you
at the Hackathon.  I'm finally getting 'round
to installing Git.  Been working on the Go
Board code?

Me: I'm a bit too busy.  But would love to 
work on it if I had the time.

Stay in touch: dharasty@gmail.com.
Mobile: 732-637-9840.

Maybe we'll cross paths again.

Best,

Dan
